# Churn Analysis Insights

## Key Findings

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Significant class imbalance detected in churn distribution
- Multiple categorical features require encoding for model training
- Missing value patterns suggest data quality issues in certain columns

**Model Performance:**
- LightGBM baseline achieves strong AUC-PR performance optimized for imbalanced data
- Class weighting effectively handles minority class prediction
- Early stopping prevents overfitting on validation set

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- Top predictive features indicate customer behavior patterns strongly correlate with churn
- Contract type, payment method, and service usage emerge as key indicators
- Tenure and monthly charges show non-linear relationships with churn probability

**Business Recommendation:**
Implement proactive retention program targeting high-risk customers identified by the model. Focus on customers with month-to-month contracts, electronic check payments, and specific service usage patterns. Deploy targeted interventions 30 days before predicted churn events to maximize retention ROI.

**Technical Considerations:**
- Model requires regular retraining to handle concept drift
- Feature importance monitoring essential for detecting changing customer behavior
- Consider ensemble methods for production deployment to improve robustness
